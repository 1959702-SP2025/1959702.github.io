# About Me
## My Interest  
I really love cooking for my family and I usually listen to music and sing while doing it. I am always researching different learning activities to share with my toddler, being that I work from school and home-school. My family are also into sports, so we are outside in nature a lot while practicing whatever sport we choose for that day.
## Websites I recommend
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com)
I love this website because I create digitial content to help promote whatever it is I am working on!
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
YouTube is another great learning tool for almost anything. Whenever I need help with learning something, I visit YouTube. They have "how-to's" on literally everything!
