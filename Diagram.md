 ## Brief Description of Pie Chart  
### This pie chart shows the main daily tasks that I have to complete _each_ day.  
Being I work from home and also a mother who homeschools her kid, I have to be mindful of how I spend my time. *Working my full-time job* takes majority of my time beinf that I have a set schedule, but not as much as *homeschooling my kid.*  
While completing those two _major_ tasks, I have to also upkeep my home/office. After, checking off all these daily commitments, I then get to spend the remainder of my day focuses on my *personal time.*
